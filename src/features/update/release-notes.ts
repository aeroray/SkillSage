/**
 * Release notes come from the update manifest, which is fetched over the
 * network from whichever mirror wins the race. They are rendered as React
 * elements and never as HTML, and that is a security decision rather than a
 * styling one: the minisign signature covers the *installer*, not the manifest,
 * so `notes` is untrusted text. Treating it as markup would let any mirror that
 * answered fastest inject into the settings page. Parsing into plain strings
 * makes injection impossible by construction, since React escapes every value.
 *
 * The grammar is deliberately small — it covers the shape we author in
 * `docs/releases/<tag>.md` and nothing else. Anything unrecognized falls
 * through to a plain paragraph rather than being dropped, so a note can never
 * silently disappear.
