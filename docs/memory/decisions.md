## 2026-08-17 - Use local MemoryCustodian memory

Decision:
Store durable project memory in `docs/memory/` and route Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, generic agents, and GitHub Copilot through short platform entry files.
Reason:
This keeps project context local, inspectable, portable, and consistent across supported agent platforms.
